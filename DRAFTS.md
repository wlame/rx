Please design a feature that will make possible to build a complex conditions between pattern matches in same file. I want give the user a possibility to define few regex patterns and a condition between them like "(p1 AND p2) or p3 or (p2 AND NOT p4)" and the new endpoint should return only files that match that given requirements. I didn't think yet how to support that for both web API and cli params, but it need to be supported. Any ideas how to achieve that based on what we have and to not break current features of the app?
